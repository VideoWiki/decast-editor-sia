# Decast - Decentralized P2P Video Casting Platform

## Project Summary

### Creativity & Inspiration

The inspiration for Decast stems from the decentralized nature of P2P torrent technology. While torrenting enhances download speed through peer-to-peer sharing, Decast takes a similar decentralized approach for video casting. It leverages a community-driven model, where users contribute resources for live video streaming, optimizing efficiency, scalability, and reliability.

### What it does

Decast is a decentralized P2P network for video casting, offering:

1. **Decentralized Video Streaming:** Users stream video content from multiple distributed sources, creating a dynamic and distributed network for content delivery.

2. **Distribution of Live Video:** Live video content is distributed across a network of users, utilizing their combined resources for streaming, promoting a collaborative ecosystem.

3. **Dynamic Content Delivery:** Users contribute parts of the live video stream, ensuring efficient resource utilization and a reliable streaming experience.

4. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Optimizes bandwidth and processing power of multiple nodes, ensuring smoother and more reliable streaming.

5. **Scalability and Reliability:** Unlike traditional services, Decast becomes stronger and lighter with more users, enhancing reliability and uptime.

6. **Community-Driven Streaming:** Active user participation is encouraged, creating a reward system for Creators, Operators, and Promoters.

## About Product

### How Decast harnesses the power of Sia

Decast integrates with Sia's decentralized storage network for secure, private, and reliable video storage. Utilizing Sia offers benefits such as redundancy, cost savings, reliability, proof-of-storage, security, censorship resistance, scalability, automation, modular integration, and future-proofing.

### Adoption of Sia in Decast

Decast leverages Sia for secure storage of final edited videos after post-production. The process involves encryption, distributed redundancy, and efficient video delivery and streaming, ensuring high availability and throughput.

### What is it - What it does & Practical Viability

Decast empowers content creators with AI technologies for live casting, post-production, and secure video storage. It aims to revolutionize content creation with a decentralized and distributed system, offering better performance and resilience.

### Solution - Technical Complexity

Decast faces technical challenges, including Sia integration complexities, AI-driven backend, video upload and processing, blockchain integration, real-time video distribution, dynamic contribution, scalability, and load-balancing. Overcoming these challenges ensures a robust platform.
